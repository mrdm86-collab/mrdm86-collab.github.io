## Why Astro?

Astro is a **content-first** web framework. Unlike Next.js, it ships zero JavaScript to the client by default.

### Code Block Demo

Here is a React component example:

```jsx
import React from 'react';

export default function Button() {
  return <button className="bg-blue-500 text-white">Click me</button>;
}
List Style
Blazing Fast (0 KB JS by default)

Islands Architecture

TypeScript Support
"The future of web development is static-first."
